* Your aims or motivations for selecting the given topic for your app. That is, why did you choose to develop this particular app, and why is this (at least potentially) a useful or interesting app?

* I wanted to create an app that would be useful to users that don't normally use apps for their work, like with sewing/upholstry projects. To have a convenient place to store all the data for a job is nice, instead of carrying a large book with graph paper around. I thought it would be nice to have access to an internal map that can be populated with an address without having to leave the application would be nice. It is easy to forget an address whie trying to pull up another map app. 


* A description of the current state of completion/readiness of your app. This should include a “hit list” of deficiencies: any unimplemented/incomplete elements, and known bugs, that would have to be implemented or corrected for a usable prototype (i.e. one that could be given to a skilled user for testing and feedback), ordered with the most urgent items first.

Right now, my app builds without errors.

I need to complete the 3 DialogFragments with the layouts
Add map api
add google signin
Link Email to floating action button
i forgot...i had wanted to add the option to save app the app to storage.

Bugs?
Icon Images don't show up on navigation drawer

* A list of Android API versions and hardware (including emulators) on which you’ve tested the submitted version of your app, the minimum Android API required, and any other hardware/software/orientation restrictions that you’re aware of. (This includes restrictions on device language, orientation, etc.)

Pixel API 22 emulator
Pixel XL 22 emulator
ZTE 9518 android 5.1 version phone

minSdkVersion 21

i only tested my app in vertical layout.
so i think that only having the orientation as vertical, would be the best option.


* A list of the 3rd-party libraries (i.e. anything beyond the Android standard and support libraries) used by your app.
Stetho
Persistence

* A list of the external services (including Google services such as Sign In, Calendar, Maps, etc.) consumed by your app.
Sign In
Contacts
Maps

* A list of aesthetic/cosmetic (not functional) improvements that you think would improve your app. This list should be ordered, with those that would give the most improvement (in your opinion) listed first.

Fix images
Color scheme..more uniform
Add dimension to the buttons and layouts

* A list of functional stretch goals. These should be sorted either with those that would add the most utility at the top, or with those that would be the simplest to implement at the top.

I really have no idea what would be the simplest to implement first
I will be working on completing the Dialog fragments with their corresponding java classes
